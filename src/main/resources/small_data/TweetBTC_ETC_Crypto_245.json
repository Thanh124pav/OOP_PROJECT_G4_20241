  "content" : "On this 8th birthday of #Ethereum, a little throw back to May 2, 2015, in Tokyo, just before #ETH was officially born. \n@VitalikButerin\n stayed in my apartment in Tokyo during this trip. He was already working on and talking about ETH non-stop. And I still missed (didn't buy) ETH. A miss of a life time. \n\nBut then again, if I had bought ETH then, I might not have had the need or drive to start Binance. Who knows? \n\nI was \"in between jobs\" (and shorts & flip flops). Life gives you not too many, but multiple chances. \n\nWork hard, don't miss the 2nd chances.\n\nFirst time sharing this photo. Some OGs in this one.",
